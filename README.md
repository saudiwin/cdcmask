# A replication and critique of the CDC's mask mandate study

This repository holds the Rmarkdown document and data to produce my blog post about the CDC's recent mask study. You can read the full blog post here: http://www.robertkubinec.com/post/cdc_fe/. The data folder contains processed versions of the CDC's mask, bars, restaurants, stay-at-home and mass gathering orders for counties as RDS files (an R serialized object file).
